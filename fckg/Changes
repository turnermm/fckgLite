rev 13-Jan_05-11_38

6 June
Upgraded from FCKeditor 2.4.1 to 2.6.6.  2.6.6 includes the scayt spellchecker, which is an in-editor spellchecker.
2.6.6 is the final FCKeditor before the change-over to CKeditor.  The upgrade required bringing the ie and gecko 
javascript files into sync, in particular so that the image and link dialogs open to a larger size.
This upgrade will now be designated fckgLite 07.

7 June 
Added configuration options for turning SCAYT on and off, setting it as auto,  and for selecting SCAYT language . 
Hide language selection button for SpellerPages spell checker when SCAYT is in effect.

9 June
Converted Arabic language file for fckg editing window from BOM to non-BOM (Corrupted image display).
Enabled overflow and scrolling in SCAYT dialog.

10 June
Increased sizes of link and image dialog windows in gecko. Adjusted font sizes in link.html

11 June 
Corrected url in Anteater safe encodig message (meta.php)

5 July 2012
Fix to FCKEditor fck_link.js for IE9, where FCKeditor's Selection.SelectNode() fails to insert link at 
cursor position if text not previously selected. This only comes into play if fckgLite is prevent from
auto-switching IE to IE8 compatibility while in editing mode.

7 July 2012
Fix to FCKeditor fck_image.js for IE9, where FCK.InsertElement failed to insert image at
cursor. (See fck_link 5 July 2012).

9 July
Removed some unnecessary files from distribution and comproessed  old Changs files to zip.

Confined IE image and link fixes to IE9 since FCKeditor will not load in IE10.  Users of IE10
where templates force Standards Mode will have to manually switch to compatibilty mode.
In other cases, fckgLite auto-switches to IE8 compatibility,

23 August
Fixed for smileys in lists where CR was lost if smiley was in li

24 August
fckeditor/dwsmileys.php: set alternate path for ajax access to smiley.conf in debian and ubuntu

25 August
Set IE compatiblity mode to IE=EmulateIE8 in file browser when browserMode > 8 (used writeln in file: fckxml.js).
This was needed by IE 10.

28 August
Implemented option to rewrite FCKeditor smiley URLs when pages are moved to new server. Regex at top of
edit.php:_preprocess.  The URLs are reset on a page by page basis when loaded and saved.  The option
should be turned off except when needed.

20 September
Minor edit (removed stray quotation mark attached to attribute name in edit.php form tag)

9 October 2012
Fixed bug where table markup inside code blocks dropped empty cells (edit.php::_preprocess)

20 Nov
Added session_id check to config.php:  in some system setting session which has already been set throws
an error.

Added $mssg="" to FileUpload() in commands.php for SendUploadResults(), without which some systems freeze.

Both of the above occurred on Windows with PHP 5.3

25 Nov
Removed stray character from top of fckconfig.js. Updated handling of mime types in config.php.

27 Nov
Fixes in fckeditor plugin font.html and edit.php for current less permissive browsers.

27 Nov Update
Minor edits to edit.php and fonts.html to accommodate stricter evaluation of undefines in IE10

29 Nov
Fixed regex which removed precent-escaped backslashes in plugin syntax so that backslashes are
removed only around non-alpha characters, preserving sequences such as \r\n.

30 Nov
Added two  short-cut keys for numbered list: ctrl-+ and ctrl+{.  Both do the same thing.

8 Dec
In edit.php: insert this.is_smiley = false after alt (text form of smiley) is added to results;
prevents corruption of text formats and insertion of javascript 'undefined' when alt is not found
on next time through start()

Updated fck_editorarea.css.new_template for code blocks
